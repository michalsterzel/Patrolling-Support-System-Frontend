## About The Project

Patrolling support system is a web application designed to streamline the process of organizing and executing patrol works from the perspective of the coordinator. The application's main goal is to aid the coordinator in their tasks by delivering a intuitive user interface and tools necessary to conduct the patrol task. Among the currently available features there are:
 * Fully functional interactive map along with a checkpoint system allowing for placing markers in areas of interest
 * Task system allowing the coordinator to assign individual tasks to patrol group members
 * A report system for evaluating the results of patrol group member tasks
 * A file pipeline between patrol group members and the coordinator enabling the upload of images and audio files
 * Chat with all members of the patrol group


The application consists of a React.js front-end utilizing GoogleMaps API and a back-end based on Google Firestore API utilizing it's Authentication and Storage features.
